### Future Plan
> More front ends should be implemented.<br>
> Game logic should be applied to the front end.<br>
> The code in the game logic needs to be modified to make the game work well.<br>
> the back-end and front-end are combined to allow the game to be played.<br>
> Distribute the game.<br>

### Why We Select this Dev Stack?
The frameworks available to team members were different.<br>
we thought we could understand each other's code more since Vue.js has a clear separation between html, css, and js.<br>
